[h2]Known Issues[/h2]
[b]Double bars / vanilla and modded bars visible[/b]
Double bars can be caused by changing the games language, the very first installation of this mod or a conflicting mod.
This mod currently is incompatible with any other mod that alters the boss bar design in any way. This issue manifests itself that the vanilla boss hp bar is visible alongside the bars added by this mod.

To fix this issue, if you have, deactivate all other mods that alter the boss bar design, and restart the game.
